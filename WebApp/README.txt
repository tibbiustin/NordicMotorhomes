++++++++++++++ A LITTLE GUIDE THROUGH THE SYSTEM ++++++++++++++

On the main page, you can see all the vehicles and you can book them from there. However, you have to be logged in first.
If you don’t have an account, just press “Sign Up” button from the top right side. The register form will appear.
You should provide real names, CPRs and email adresses. The CPR should have 10 digits, otherwise an error will pop up.
The email should not be registered before. After making sure the form is filled accordingly, the user can press
the “Register” button. If it’s successful, he will be redirected to the main page and logged in.
If you already have an account, you can press the “Login” button from top right side. A form asking for your email
and password will appear. After writing your email and password, the “Login” button should be pressed. You will
be redirected to the first page. 

For booking a vehicle, you just figure out which one you want and move your mouse next to the “Departure” field.
You can either write the date for departure manually or select it from a the calendar. After doing the same thing
with the “Return” field, you can press “Book Now”. If there’s any problem with the selected dates, a message will pop up.
Otherwise, the user will be redirected to the reservation page. There, he can see the name of the vehicle selected,
the price and the id. The fields “Distance from our pickup location” and “Distance from our dropoff location” should
be completed as following: If you live 6 kilometers away from the motorhome’s parking spot and you want it delivered
at your house, you should write “6” in the “pickup location” field. If you want to go and pick the motorhome by yourself,
you should write “0”. Same thing for the “drop off location” field. 

If you want your motorhome to have a bike rack, just press on the checkbox next to “Bike”. If you want a child seat,
check the box next to “Child”. Same thing for wanting a picnic table and paying by card. After pressing book, a receipt
will appear. If you selected card, some fields for your card information will be on the bottom of the page as well. After
entering the card’s number, expiry date and security code, the reservation will be paid.
Back to the main page. If you are logged in, you will have a Button in the top right side name “My reservations”.
If you press it, you will see all your reservations. You can cancel any reservation by pressing the “Cancel” button
next to the desired item. A popup message containing the price you have to pay for cancelling will appear. Then,
the reservation is cancelled. You can log out as well by pressing the “Log out” button”.
